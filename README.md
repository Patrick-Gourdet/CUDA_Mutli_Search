# CUDA_Mutli_Search
I can only speak for myself when saying I would sit there and think there has to be a better way well there is.
When presented with family shapes, and they are all different colors and tasked with finding the red one you first, you look at the entire set, distinguish the red ball, and done. A search algorithm having the same capabilities is practically unheard of, until now. I am sure you are aware of the standard procedure, given an unordered list. First, we sort with a sorting algorithm of choice then; you would have to go through each element to assure that a component was not in the given set (depending on the algorithm), but even with binary search the best you can hope to do is O(nLog (n)). With GPU processing, this is no longer an issue; each element has its observer (thread) and thus eliminates two things the need to sort a list and the need to in look at every element in serial. Searching an array for item x O(1) is possible and that without a Hashmap, and depending on the number of blocks used
